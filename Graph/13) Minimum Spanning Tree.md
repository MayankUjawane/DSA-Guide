# Minimum Spanning Tree
> A **spanning tree** of a graph is a collection of connected edges that include **every vertex in the graph**, but that **do not form a cycle**. 
> Many such spanning trees may exist for a graph. The **Minimum Spanning Tree** is the one whose **cumulative edge weights have the minimum value** than all other spanning trees 
> of the same graph. Think of it as the **least cost path** that goes through the **entire graph and touches every vertex**.

### General Properties of Spanning Tree
> Following are a few properties of the spanning tree connected to graph G âˆ’
> * A connected graph G can have **more than one spanning tree**.
> * All possible spanning trees of graph G, have the **same number of edges and vertices**.
> * The spanning tree does not have any **cycle (loops)**.
> * Removing one edge from the spanning tree will make the graph disconnected, i.e. the spanning tree is **minimally connected**.
> * Adding one edge to the spanning tree will create a circuit or loop, i.e. the spanning tree is **maximally acyclic**.
### There are two famous algorithms for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree:
> * Prim's Algorithm
> * Kruskal's Algorithm
