# Binary Search Tree
>**Binary Search Tree** is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:
> * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
> * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
> * The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

### Time Complexity of different operations in BST
>**Search:** In general, time complexity for searching is **O(h)** where h is **height** of BST.    
>**Insert:** In general, time complexity for searching is **O(h)** where h is **height** of BST.    
>**Delete:** In general, time complexity for searching is **O(h)** where h is **height** of BST.
