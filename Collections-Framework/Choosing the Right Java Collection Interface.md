* **List** is a collection where data is kept in order of insertion and each element got index.     
* **Set** is a bag of elements without duplication (if you reinsert the same element, it won't be added). Data doesn't have the notion of order.    
* **Map** You access and write your data elements by their key, which could be any possible object.
